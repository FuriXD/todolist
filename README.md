# todolist
This To-Do List is a simple and clean web-based application interface designed using only HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to create a visually appealing layout where users can view and organize their tasks. Although the list is static without JavaScript, the CSS styling gives a modern and interactive feel to the list items.
Project Structure
HTML:

The HTML structure consists of a container that holds a heading, an input field for new tasks (displayed for design purposes only), and a list of task items.
Each task item has a checkbox, task description, and a delete icon to indicate possible future interactions.
CSS:

The CSS adds style to the container, input field, list items, checkboxes, and delete icons.
CSS pseudo-classes are used to create hover and focus effects to give a dynamic feel even without JavaScript.
Detailed Description of Each Part
Container:

The main container has a fixed width and is centered on the page.
It has padding and a background color with rounded corners for a smooth look.
A subtle shadow is added to lift it off the page, giving a card-like appearance.
Header:

A header displays "To-Do List" or any similar title.
Styled with larger, bold text to make it stand out, along with some margin for spacing.
Input Field:

An input field is included to visually represent where a user could enter a new task.
The field has padding, rounded corners, and a slight border.
A placeholder text is added, saying "Add a new taskâ€¦", which disappears when the field is focused.
Task List:

Each task is presented as a list item with a checkbox, task description, and delete icon.
Checkboxes are styled to match the theme, and each task description has padding and spacing to separate it visually.
Delete icons are styled as small, clickable icons (e.g., trash can or "X" symbol), though they are non-functional in this CSS-only version.
When hovering over a task item, the background color slightly changes to indicate interactivity.
Task Completed Styling:

The CSS applies a "completed" style when a checkbox is checked (using a CSS :checked pseudo-class).
This style could include:
Strikethrough text for the task description.
Faded color to show that the task is completed.
