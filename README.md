# todolist
This To-Do List is a simple and clean web-based application interface designed using only HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to create a visually appealing layout where users can view and organize their tasks. Although the list is static without JavaScript, the CSS styling gives a modern and interactive feel to the list items.
